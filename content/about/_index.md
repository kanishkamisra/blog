I am an undergraduate student at Purdue University, aspiring to study social science using 
computational methods to eventually contribute to the growth of a fact based world-view.


I am currently working with Dr. Julia Rayz and Dr. Kathryn C. Seigfried-Spellar in order to
understand online predator behavior by using text as data (preferably in R). 


This blog is built using blogdown and renders my analyses in Rmarkdown into visually appealing
(hopefully) blog posts that you can read and comment about.
