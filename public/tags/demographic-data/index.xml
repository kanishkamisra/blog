      <description>Background Ever since I worked on data about populations at my internship at Perscio, a healthcare data analysis firm in Indianapolis, as well as worked with a Professor of Demography and Social Policy on a paper about demographic data, I have gained interest in population problems - mostly through readings.
The best way to restart this journey would be to do so using what population problems often involve: Data analysis. In this post, we define and calculate population growth rates as well as doubling times of several countries and then finally produce intuitive visualizations of these numbers.</description>
